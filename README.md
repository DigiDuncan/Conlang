# Conlang
> [!WARNING]
> This is an ***extremely under construction*** repository.

This is the working area for a currently-unnamed conlang.

Do *you* have any reason to be here? Likely not; if you're not the intended audience I'm not going to spend a lot of time explaining this, sadly.
I will however direct you to the [Wikipedia article on the subject](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language), the [Reddit community](https://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs/), and the [Language Creation Society](https://conlang.org/).

## Point Of This Conlang
There are many ideas and thoughts I have on a daily basis that I find difficult to express in the one language I know, English. I also have a lot of frustration with some of the shortcomings of English. I want to make something that lets me express myself more *correctly*, if not more coherently (due to my assumption that no one else will learn this language.)

Key ideas include:
- **Synthetic language**: forces you to describe a concept to speak about it, requiring introspection on the part of the speaker and revealing personal associations to the listener
  - You probably know of German being an synthetic language, but the a more apt comparison to the *purpose* of this choice (if not the implementation) is [toki pona](https://tokipona.org/).
- **No gendered pronouns**: instead, different pronoun types exist for distinctions like animate/inanimate, and subject/object.
- **A base 16 counting system**: not only for ease of use with computers, but because of the humans brains natural ability to double/half something mentally.
- **Adjectives after nouns**: in order to allow the listener to "build the scene" in their head.
- **Way too many tenses**: *perpetual*, *certainty*, *retcon*... the list goes on.
- **Neutral-connotation adjectives**: in order to speak about concepts without imbuing them with a "stance;" affixes exist to modify this
- **Grammatical paranthesis**: to clear up confusion about when clauses begin/end
- **A grammatical way to speak about the complex number plane**: because frankly we don't have a good one

More will be added to this list as time goes on, but these are the points I've thought of over the last year or two.

I intend for the orthography to be easily readable and for a bespoke writing system to be made that emphasises the meaning of some of the features here.
