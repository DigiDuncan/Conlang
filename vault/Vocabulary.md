## Pronouns

All pronouns end in *-n*.

| type                     | word  | description                                           |
| ------------------------ | ----- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| first person             | sivan | "I", from *si + va*, subjective sense                 |
| second person            | savan | "you", from *sa + va*, similar sense                  |
| third person (animate)   | kavan | "they" (singular), from *komsa + va*, different sense |
| third person (inanimate) | kan   | "it", from *kavan*, but with no *va* (sense)          |
Pronouns can add -pu or -up to signify subject/object. Think of it as the subject is what the action comes *out* of, and the object is what the action goes *in* to. *Kavanpu* is a third person specifying they did the action, whereas *kavanup* is the person the action was done to. These can be shortened to *kavpu* and *kavup*.


> [!CASUAL] Casual
> In casual usage, the *va* can be dropped from these words; *sivan* becomes *sin*, *savan* becomes *san*, and *kavan* becomes *kan*, which technically makes it indistinguishable from the actual word *kan* without context.


Pronouns can be modified in two other cases, *relational* and *descriptive*. Relational modifiers identify the speaker's relationship to the person being spoken about, and descriptive modifiers specify the target more clearly by adding adjectives.

### Relational Modifiers

Relational modifiers are always optional, and are added the end of a pronoun (or name) to signify the spoken about's relationship to the speaker.

| suffix | definition                           |
| ------ | ------------------------------------ |
| -      | on the same level as the speaker[^2] |
| -      | on a higher level than the speaker   |
| -      | on a lower level than the speaker    |


## Numbers

> [!NOTE] Remember!
> Numbers are in base-16! When it's unclear, the base of a number will be marked in subscript.


| 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| o   | i   | mi  | me  | hi  | he  | pi  | pe  |

| 8   | 9   | 10/A | 11/B | 12/C | 13/D | 14/E | 15/F |
| --- | --- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| kon | kin | kimi | kime | kihi | kihe | kipi | kipe |

For the next numbers, add *-a* to the end of the number word in the slots other than the final one. For instance, 188<sub>10</sub> (BC<sub>16</sub>) would be *kimea-kihi*. Numbers never end with *-a*; instead, 70<sub>16</sub> would be *peao*.[^1] 

The *thousand* equivalent is ending the number in *-ba* (from the word for big), and this can be stacked every 16<sup>3</sup> (so the *million* equivalent is *-baba*). As an example, DEADBEEF<sub>16</sub> reads as *kiheakipibaba-kimiakiheaba-kipiakipiakipe*, which has a value of 3,735,928,559<sub>10</sub>.

If you *must* use Base 10 (decimal) numbers, you can use *-u* as a separator instead of *-a*. For instance, 98<sub>10</sub> would be *kinu-kon*. Equivalently, *-ba* becomes *-bu*.

Negative numbers add the negation operator *kom-*, as in negative 4, *komhi*.
### Math Words

| word   | definition | notes                            |
| ------ | ---------- | -------------------------------- |
| mipa   | to double  | from *mi + pa*, or "two-ing"     |
| kompia | to half    | from *kom- + mipa*, "un-two-ing" |

## Affixes

| word | definition                            | notes                                                  |
| ---- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| kom- | not, negation, "un-"                  | if prefixed to a word that starts with *m*, drop one m |
| kam- | opposite, "anti-"                     |                                                        |
| -pa  | turns a noun into a verb              | see [[#Nouns]]                                         |
| -m&  | turns a noun into an adjective        | like English *-y*                                      |
| -p&  | turns a verb into a doer of that verb | like English *-er*                                     |

## Tone Indicators

Some words and suffixes can be used to modify a sentence of word to indicate the intended tone, since by default tone is assumed neutral.

| word/suffix | tone indicator  |
| ----------- | --------------- |
| -iti        | positive (/pos) |
| -uhu        | negative (/neg) |
|             |                 |

[^1]: I might revisit this; I like the idea that you can always tell a number is "over," though.
[^2]: What "level" means is contextual -- this may be revised later since it somewhat flies in the face of "making difficult concepts easier to understand" when I introduce a difficult concept that isn't clearly defined.
