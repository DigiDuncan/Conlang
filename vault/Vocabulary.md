## Base Words
- &
	- thing, generic inanimate pronoun, object
- pa
	- action, verb
	- *-pa* can be used to make something into a verb
- up
	- in
- pu
	- out
- va
	- sense (like sight and sound, but generic)
- si
	- subjectivity (*komsi* is the opposite, objectivity)
- sa
	- similarity (*komsa* is the opposite, differentness)
## Pronouns

All pronouns end in *-n*.

| type                     | word  | description                            |
| ------------------------ | ----- | -------------------------------------- |
| first person             | sivan | from *si + va*, subjective sense       |
| second person            | savan | from *sa + va*, similar sense          |
| third person (animate)   | kavan | from *komsa + va*, different sense     |
| third person (inanimate) | kan   | from *kavan*, but with no *va* (sense) |
Pronouns can add -pu or -up to signify subject/object. Think of it as the subject is what the action comes *out* of, and the object is what the action goes *in* to. *Kavanpu* is a third person specifying they did the action, whereas *kavanup* is the person the action was done to. These can be shortened to *kavpu* and *kavup*.

Pronouns can be modified in two other cases, *relational* and *descriptive*. Relational modifiers identify the speaker's relationship to the person being spoken about, and descriptive modifiers specify the target more clearly by adding adjectives.
## Numbers

> [!NOTE] Remember!
> Numbers are in base-16! When it's unclear, the base of a number will be marked in subscript.


| 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| o   | i   | mi  | me  | hi  | he  | pi  | pe  |

| 8   | 9   | 10/A | 11/B | 12/C | 13/D | 14/E | 15/F |
| --- | --- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| kon | kin | kimi | kime | kihi | kihe | kipi | kipe |
For the next numbers, add -a to the end of the number word in the slots other than the final one. For instance, 188<sub>10</sub> (BC<sub>16</sub>) would be *kimea-kihi*.

If you *must* use Base 10 (decimal) numbers, you can use *-u* as a separator instead of *-a*. For instance, 98<sub>10</sub> would be *kinu-kon*.

Negative numbers add the negation operator *kom-*, as in negative 4, *komhi*.
