## Pronouns

| type                     | word |
| ------------------------ | ---- |
| first person             |      |
| second person            |      |
| third person (animate)   |      |
| third person (inanimate) |      |
Pronouns can add -pu or -up to signify subject/object. Think of it as the subject is what the action comes *out* of, and the object is what the action goes *in* to.
## Numbers

> [!NOTE] Remember!
> Numbers are in base-16! When it's unclear, the base of a number will be marked in subscript.


| 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| o   | i   | mi  | me  | hi  | he  | pi  | pe  |

| 8   | 9   | 10/A | 11/B | 12/C | 13/D | 14/E | 15/F |
| --- | --- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| kon | kin | kimi | kime | kihi | kihe | kipi | kipe |
For the next numbers, add -a to the end of the number word in the slots other than the final one. For instance, 188<sub>10</sub> (BC<sub>16</sub>) would be *kimea-kihi*.

Negative numbers add the negation operator *kom-*, as in negative 4, *komhi*.
