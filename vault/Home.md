The big goal is "a language able to describe difficult concepts."

- **Synthetic language**: forces you to describe a concept to speak about it, requiring introspection on the part of the speaker and revealing personal associations to the listener
  - You probably know of German being an synthetic language, but the a more apt comparison to the *purpose* of this choice (if not the implementation) is [toki pona](https://tokipona.org/).
- **No gendered pronouns**: instead, different pronoun types exist for distinctions like animate/inanimate, and subject/object.
- **A base 16 counting system**: not only for ease of use with computers, but because of the humans brains natural ability to double/half something mentally.
- **Adjectives after nouns**: in order to allow the listener to "build the scene" in their head.
- **Way too many tenses**: *perpetual*, *certainty*, *retcon*... the list goes on.
- **Neutral-connotation adjectives**: in order to speak about concepts without imbuing them with a "stance;" affixes exist to modify this
- **Grammatical parenthesis**: to clear up confusion about when clauses begin/end
- **A grammatical way to speak about the complex number plane**: because frankly we don't have a good one

The orthography should be easily readable, and a bespoke writing system will be made that emphasizes the meaning of some of the features here.
